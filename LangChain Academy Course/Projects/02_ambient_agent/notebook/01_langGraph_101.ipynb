    "\n",
    "[LLMs](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) make it possible to embed intelligence into a new class of applications. [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a framework to help build applications with LLMs. Here, we will overview the basics of LangGraph, explain its benefits, show how to use it to build workflows / agents, and show how it works with [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) / [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/).\n",

    "## Chat models\n",
    "\n",
    "[Chat models](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) are the foundation of LLM applications. They are typically accessed through a chat interface that takes a list of [messages](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) as input and returns a [message](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/messages/) as output. LangChain provides [a standardized interface for chat models](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/chat_models/langchain.chat_models.base.init_chat_model.html), making it easy to [access many different providers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/)."

    "- `invoke()`: A single input is transformed into an output.\n",

    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "[Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tools/) are utilities that can be called by a chat model. In LangChain, creating tools can be done using the `@tool` decorator, which transforms Python functions into callable tools. It will automatically infer the tool's name, description, and expected arguments from the function definition. You can also use [Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters) as LangChain-compatible tools. "

    "## Tool Calling\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools can be [called](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/tool_calling/) by LLMs. When a tool is bound to the model, the model can choose to call the tool by returning a structured output with tool arguments. We use the `bind_tools` method to augment an LLM with tools.\n",

    "Providers often have [parameters such as `tool_choice`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/tool_choice/) to enforce calling specific tools. `any` will select at least one of the tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we can [set `parallel_tool_calls=False`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/tool_calling_parallel/) to ensure the model will only call one tool at a time."

    "## Workflows\n",
    " \n",
    "There are many patterns for building applications with LLMs. \n",
    "\n",
    "[We can embed LLM calls into pre-defined workflows](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/), giving the system more agency to make decisions. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further increase agency, allowing the LLM to dynamically direct its own tool usage. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Agents](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/workflows/#agent) are typically implemented as tool calling in a loop, where the output of each tool call is used to inform the next action.\n",
    "\n",
    "![agent_example](img/agent_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents are well suited to open-ended problems where it's difficult to predict the *exact* steps needed in advance.\n",
    " \n",
    "Workflows are often appropriate when the control flow can easily be defined in advance. \n",
    "\n",
    "![workflow_v_agent](img/workflow_v_agent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LangGraph? \n",
    "\n",
    "[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/high_level/) provides low-level supporting infrastructure that sits underneath *any* workflow or agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does not abstract prompts or architecture, and provides a few benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control**: Make it easy to define and / or combine agents and workflows.\n",
    "- **Persistence**: Provide a way to persist the state of a graph, which enables both memory and human-in-the-loop.\n",
    "- **Testing, Debugging, and Deployment**: Provide an easy onramp for testing, debugging, and deploying applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph lets you define your application as a graph with:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *State*: What information do we need to track over the course of the application?\n",
    "2. *Nodes*: How do we want to update this information over the course of the application?\n",
    "3. *Edges*: How do we want to connect these nodes together?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the [`StateGraph` class](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#graphs) to initialize a LangGraph graph with a [`State` object](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#state).\n",
    "\n",
    "`State` defines the schema for information we want to track over the course of the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be any object with `getattr()` in python, such as a dictionary, dataclass, or Pydantic object: \n",
    "\n",
    "- TypeDict is fastest but doesn’t support defaults\n",
    "- Dataclass is basically as fast, supports dot syntax `state.foo`, and has defaults. \n",
    "- Pydantic is slower (especially with custom validators) but gives type validation."
