This is why testing is important: it guides our decisions about our agent architecture with quantifiable metrics like response quality, token usage, latency, or triage accuracy.

LangSmith integrates with these frameworks to allow you to write and run tests that log results to LangSmith. For this notebook, we'll use Pytest.\n",
