If the device won’t turn on, overheating could have triggered a protective shutdown, or there could be another issue.\\n\\nWhat you can do now:\\n- Power down and unplug the device. If possible, remove the battery and let it cool for 15–30 minutes in a well-ventilated area.\\n- Check vents and fans. Look for dust blocking the intake/exhaust and gently clean with compressed air if you can.\\n- Make sure the device has good airflow. Don’t use it on a bed, couch, or any soft surface.\\n- After it’s cooled, try turning it on again. If it still won’t start, try a power cycle: hold the power button for 15–20 seconds, then reconnect power and turn on.\\n- If you can boot, monitor temps with software (examples: HWMonitor/Core Temp on Windows, iStat Menus or Macs Fan Control on macOS, or lm-sensors on Linux). Look for sustained high temps or fans not spinning.\\n- Check running software for high CPU/GPU load. End unnecessary tasks and update drivers/BIOS/firmware.\\n- Consider a cooling aid (cooling pad, better room ventilation) and ensure the environment is cool.\\n- If temps stay high or the device still won’t turn on after cooling, there may be a hardware issue (fan failure, thermal paste, battery, motherboard). Contact support or a repair service, especially if it’s under warranty.\\n\\nIf you can tell me the device type (laptop/desktop/phone/tablet) and the OS, I can tailor exact steps and any specific software to use.
