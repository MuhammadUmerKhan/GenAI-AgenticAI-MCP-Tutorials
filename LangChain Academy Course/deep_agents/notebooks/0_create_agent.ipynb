It selects a tool to invoke, forms the tool call. This is sent to a tool node for execution. The tool node executes the tool(s), and sends the results (observations) back to the LLM. The LLM receives the observations(s) and uses that observation to inform the next action. The loop continues until a stopping condition is met — typically when the agent decides it no longer needs to call more tools.\n",
